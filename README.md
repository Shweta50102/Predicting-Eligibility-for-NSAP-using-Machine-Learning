# Predicting Eligibility for NSAP Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillBuild Virtual Internship Program**. It uses machine learning to predict the appropriate **National Social Assistance Program (NSAP)** scheme for applicants based on their demographic and socio-economic information.

## üìå Objective

To build a reliable multi-class classification model that:
- Predicts the most suitable NSAP sub-scheme for an individual
- Aids government agencies in automating eligibility checks
- Minimizes delays and errors in benefit distribution

---

## üß† What the Model Does

- Takes applicant data (age, gender, income, disability status, etc.)
- Preprocesses and cleans the input
- Trains a classifier to assign the correct NSAP scheme
- Helps automate the eligibility process for faster and more accurate results

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **IBM Watson Studio**
- **IBM Cloud Object Storage**
- **IBM Cloud Lite account**
